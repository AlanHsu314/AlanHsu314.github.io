Diabolo resources, tips, tricks, and videos. The goal here is to eventually document all the tricks/performamce routines I've done, which I'll organize in my own youtube playlist. To start, [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcEqdGk7sxBqInuukPbwe7ZROqM411emm) is a private playlist created by my co-instructor when we taught Diabolo for a few semesters at CMU.

Doing a quick public search online, looks like someone recorded one of my undergrad performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z80qoSY6Y0o).
